# React with Express In Glitch

Create-react-app with express boilerplate for [**Glitch.com**](https://glitch.com/). 

Uses version 0.9.5 react-scripts from create-react-app. Version 1.x react-scripts goes over the limit of space on the container.

## Install in Glitch

From the `Advanced Options`, click on `Open Console` and a new tab with a terminal for your project will popup. 

Enter the following commands in the terminal, (this step might take awhile):

1. cd views
2. yarn install
3. yarn build
4. refresh
```

The app should now be live.
